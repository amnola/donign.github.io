          You thrust your left arm towards the clown's face as if it was being attracted by a gravitational force. Your
          clenched hand accelerates quickly, but right as it's about to land the clown stops his dance.
          Your strike was succesful, and you managed to hit the clown. Now your hand is broken into a thousand
          pieces.<br><br>
          You scream in agonizing pain, looking at the sky, closing your eyes as to not gander at your twisted arm you
          used to appreciate so much by still being intact. You bite your right arm to ease the pain, piercing through
          the skin, it bleeds and you taste
          the blood as your eyes start to water down in response to the pain.
          <br><br>
          The clown emits a thunderous laugh and says in a calm tone "You lose" followed by more laughter.

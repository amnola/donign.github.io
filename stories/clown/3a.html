          You launch your left arm towards the clown's face like if it were being attracted by a gravitational force
          towards it. Your clenched hand accelerates quickly but right as it's about to land, the clown stops his dance.
          Your strike was succesful ,you managed to hit the clown, but now your hand bones are broken into thousands of
          pieces.<br><br>
          You scream in agonizing pain, looking at the sky, closing your eyes as to not gander at your twisted arm you
          used to value so much. You bite your right arm to ease the pain, piercing through, making it bleed, you taste
          the blood as your eyes start to water down in response.
          <br><br>
          The clown emits a thunderous laugh and says in a calm tone "You lose" followed by more laughter.
